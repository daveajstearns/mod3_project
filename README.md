**fill this in at the end**  

## Introduction
This project uses a data set queried from the Google Cloud Platform's *Big Data* product. This required creating an account to access the database, and subsequent SQL queries to retrieve an allotment of data. Some of the EDA and cleaning was performed directly on the BigQuery platform, however, most was performed in the Jupyter Notebooks. The structure of the Repo lends the reader to easily review our process. A table of contents will be supplied below.  
  
The data used is a from the BigQuery database. The dataset has various metrics regarding solar power across the United States. Using this data, the goal is the create a model to determine whether an applicant will benefit from solar panel installation **by being classified as qualified or not qualified**. We determined a qualification threshold based on the state energy cost and carbon offset.
