## Introduction
This project uses datasets supplied by data.gov.uk; the United Kingdom's open data effort. The purpose of this project is to build a model that can help predict whether a traffic accident is minor, severe, or fatal. The process used to achieve our results is defined below in our various notebooks regarding cleaning, interpretation, model building, and model evaluation.  
  
The idea for this project stemmed from thinking about the safety of our future roads and how ML and AI can benefit our future position as a passenger to an automated vehicle. That may sound complex; in layman's terms, we want to see if it is possible to quickly generate a label for a traffic incident to help first responders understand more about what they will encounter on the scene. We can think of our project as an additional piece to a comprehensive auto pilot system-one that can quickly read information about the occurrence-and send out an SOS beacon to local authorities with more information about what type of resources they may need. Down the road this may help to streamline the Emergency Care side of the accident, where instead of an ambulance rushing in to the loading bay and workers scramble to find a bed, OR, or doctor, the situation will be running smoothly in the background so the first responders, nurses, and doctors are 100% in sync with the task at hand without having to do any menial tasks.  

You might be asking yourself, *how would this work?* **Ask and you shall be answered!**
